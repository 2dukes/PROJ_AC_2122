# Machine Learning Project
## **To loan or not to loan?**

This data mining aims to build a model that can predict if a credit loan will be successful or not. The Jupyter Notebooks explain all the steps taken throughout the entire process of the development of the project. Please start with ***dataProcessing.ipynb***, then ***dataUnderstanding.ipynb***, and finally ***applyModel.ipynb***.
